#Puzzles!

A convenient repo for storing tons of puzzle solving functions.

##What can you solve?

We've got word-unscramblers, Caesar Ciphers, and Morse Code translators!

##What language is this?

[Haskell][1] was my language of choice for this challenge.
The functional style and the interactive prompt made it a good choice for
writing and using modular puzzle-solving code.
